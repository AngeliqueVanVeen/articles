# articles
A responsive website with 1 to 5 articles in one row.


This is an example of a website that I made, where the homepage contains articles in which there is space for an image, 
a short piece of text and a Read more button. The other pages have a navigation menu on the left.

The website is responsive so that it can be viewed on all devices.

For your convenience I have added the CSS with an Internal Style Sheet to the HTML. 
You can view the homepage with just one copy-and-paste action.
